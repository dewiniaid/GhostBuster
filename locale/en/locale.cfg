GhostBuster_allow-burners=Support entities with burners

[mod-setting-description]
GhostBuster_allow-burners=If enabled, GhostBuster will support (some) entities with burners, copying fuel and other state to their replacement.\n\nIf disabled, entities with burners will always be deconstructed+reconstructed (i.e. vanilla Factorio behavior.)\n\nOnly applies when using the "Instantly destroy and then instantly revive ghost" workaround, which should be gone in Factorio 0.17.
